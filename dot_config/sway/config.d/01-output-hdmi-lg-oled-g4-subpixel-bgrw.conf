    ## This is an HDMI electrical signal noise issue from EMF interference.
    ## Seems consistent with EMF noise, based on testing different HDMI cables,
    ## and test cases with or without Tripp-Lite grounding block(s),
    ## and Pulse-Eight CEC adapter (both with/without USB ground loop isolator)
    ## Meanwhile, 4k@30Hz has been much more stable.
